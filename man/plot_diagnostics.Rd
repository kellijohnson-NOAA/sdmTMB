\title{Plot diagnostics}
\usage{
plot_diagnostics(object, newdata = NULL, plot_type = "all", plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object from \code{\link[=sdmTMB]{sdmTMB()}}}

\item{newdata}{If passed in then predictions are made at the locations of newdata, otherwise
predictions are made at the original locations of the data}

\item{plot_type}{A string deciding which plots to show. If 'all' (default) then all plots are shown.
Plots can be shown individually by specifying 'qq' (QQ plot of randomized residuals),
'qq_over_time' (QQ plot of randomized residuals faceted by time step), 'spatial_slope' (shows spatial
field for zeta_s, if included), 'spatial_intercept' (shows omega_s, the constant spatial field or spatial
intercept, if included), 'st_over_time' (spatiotemporal effects shown across time),
'st_over_space' (spatial plots of epsilon, across all time steps), 'st_over_spacetime' (spatial plots
of epsilon, faceted by time steps), 'st_variance' (the standard deviation of epsilon deviations over
time steps), 'residuals_over_time' (distribution of randomized residuals by time step),
'residuals_over_spacetime' (randomized residuals over space and faceted by time step)}

\item{plot}{Whether to show plot the results (default = TRUE)}
